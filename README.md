# personality
I want to create a working model of my personality compatibility program.   In the intial window it will have a user login or create a new user.  It will have a database for the “user” accounts, within that will also be a location that can utilize geopy and calculate close users.  An API that will store the actually personality types and which ones are compatible with each other.  Then if all goes well I want to practice creating a GUI that can show the profile of the user.
